\begin{description}[leftmargin=5pt]
	\item [Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs).]\label{sec:methods-deg}The used dataset of gene expression profiles from dermal fibroblasts from patients with hEDS and healthy controls is available at the NCBI GEO database with the accession number GSE218012 \cite{Ritelli2020}. The analysis is performed with the R-packages DeSeq2 and limma based on the R-Script from GEO2R to identify up-regulated and down-regulated genes \cite{DESeq2, limma}. Genes with a log2-fold change $> \pm 0.5$ and a by the Benjamin-Hochberg procedure adjusted p-value $< 0.05$ are included. The cut-offs were chosen based on similar research \cite{Karimizadeh2019, Lim2019}.

	\item[Network Creation.] The Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network is created in Cytoscape \cite{Cytoscape} by querying the before-identified DEGs from the STRING database with an interaction score $> 0.4$, which reflects medium confidence \cite{StringDB}. Since hEDS belongs to the family of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes, its molecular cause is most likely closely related to other EDS types. The PPI network of the DEGs is therefore expanded by additionally querying genes related to other EDS types retrieved from Disease ontology (Disease Ontology ID 13359) \cite{DO}. The resulting network is annotated with the differential expression data.
	
	\item[Gene Ontology and Clustering.]GeneOntology (GO) enrichment is performed using the R-package clusterProfiler to gain insight into biological processes and molecular functions affected by DEGs, with results with $p < 0.05$ being considered significant \cite{Ashburner2000,Consortium2023, Wu2021}. To attain more detailed insights into specific parts, the created network is clustered using two different algorithms, resulting in different cluster structures: MCODE to analyse the molecular function and Community clustering to investigate biological processes and pathways. Only clusters of more than 15 genes are included in the analysis to ensure relevance and keep the analysis feasible in the project's scope. Further analysis of the resulting clusters includes investigating whether genes are clustered with genes that cause other EDS types and whether the resulting clusters consist of up-regulated or down-regulated genes or a combination of both.
	
	\begin{description}[leftmargin=0pt]
		\item[MCODE]MCODE is a clustering algorithm designed to find highly connected regions in PPI networks that might represent molecular complexes \cite{mcode}. MCODE was applied in Cytoscape with the clusterMaker2 app using the default parameters \cite{clusterMaker2}.
		
		\item[Community Clustering]To analyse the biological processes and pathways involved in the DEGs, larger clusters are required. GLay, a community clustering algorithm, was designed to be used for a functional interpretation of clusters in networks \cite{GLay}. Analogous to the MCODE, clustering was performed with clusterMaker2 and Cytoscape using the default parameters \cite{Cytoscape, clusterMaker2}.
		
		Heat Diffusion is applied on larger clusters to identify genes closely connected to genes causing other EDS types, starting with the EDS nodes using Cytoscape functionality \cite{heatDiffusion}, using a time parameter of $t=0.3$.
