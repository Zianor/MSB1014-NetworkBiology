\subsection{Data and Analysis of Differentially Expressed Genes}
\begin{itemize}
	\item data from geo database
	\item analysis with geo2r
	\item abs(log2FoldChange) > 0.5, pValue <0.05
	\item 908 differentially expressed genes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Network creation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item query differentially expressed genes from string db (confidence cut off 0.4)
	\item String was able to query 828 of them
	\item query eds related to other eds genes additionally: 21 nodes from DISEASE (TODO: refernce)
	\item resulting network: 847 nodes and 6129 edges
	\item visualization of whole network probably not useful
	\item data about differential expression loaded, for EDS genes and differentially expressed genes
\end{itemize}
