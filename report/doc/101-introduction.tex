\section{Introduction}

% Funnel shape (start broad, become more specific, leading to the research question)
% General description of the background and gaps that will be filled by the research
% Clear research question
\subsection{Background}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Ehlers-Danlos syndromes are a group of heritable connective tissue disorders that can be classified into multiple subtypes
	\item current classification describes 13 subtypes \cite{classification2017}
	\item most common form: hypermobile EDS (hEDS) - only subtype with unknown molecular cause
	\item diagnosis based on clinical presentation
	\item identify molecular cause for: diagnosis, understanding, potential treatment \cite{Ritelli2020}
	\item current state: ongoing study with aim to do this by analysing genes of 1000 affected individuals, results not expected before 2025 \cite{HEDGE}
	\item many studies investigated genes but no clear molecular cause with connection to connective tissue established yet \cite{Caliogna2021}
	\item until then use data known
	\item problem with existing data: criteria change in 2017, earlier diagnosed people might not classify anymore \cite{Gensemer2021} + there is a unclear overlap with Hypermobility Spectrum Disorder (HSD) and terms often used interchangeable and diagnoses often grouped together (unclear whether there is a difference) \cite{Gensemer2021, Ritelli2022}
	\item we know the clinical representation and how other eds types work (kind of)
	\item TODO: include information of what is affected, extracellular matrix, collagen, connective tissue
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Aim}

\begin{itemize}
	\item aim: investigate moleculare cause of hypermobile EDS
	\item studying differentially expressed genes in hEDS patients
	\item which biological processes and pathways are affected
	\item similarities to pathways/processes/function affected by other EDS genes
	\item TODO: what do we want to do in the big picture: find candidate genes? is this to ambitious?
\end{itemize}
