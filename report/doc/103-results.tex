\subsection{Differentially Expressed Genes and Network creation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 908 differentially expressed genes with chosen thresholds section \ref{sec:methods-deg}
	\item String was able to query 828 of them [TODO: provide table of not queried in supplementary material or at least github?]
	\item after querying additional genes that are known to be related to other eds types: resulting network with 847 nodes and 6129 edges
\end{itemize}
